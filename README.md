# Simulation of the consumption and benefits of a Photovoltaic (PV) self-consumption plant

Part of a school project (System engineering) where the goal was to study the setup of a PV self-consumption plant.

The goal here was to simulate the consumption and benefits of the installation with sun time, user consumption, variation of energy price as input data.

The simulation shows the current state of the system for each hour during one test year. It generates a report that compares energy use and energy costs with and without the installation.
